# GLOBAL

- PERHAPS THIS WILL BE HARDER TO MAKE IT WORK WITH RAILS reorganize JS code in multiple JS files (when necessary) and create a folder for them
- make games responsive ===> add touch events
- center boards and texts (cards : 1 for game board, one for score, instructions etc)
- resize boards to be at least all the same height
- create a Rails app that regroups all the games in one app.
- You can navigate via navbar (selected game is highlighted)
- (Would be good to display games with AJAX in the same centered square (with a background color OR image that fits every game)) OR choose an according background for each game (GB for tetris, etc...)
- Register to keep track of your scores (Best / Last)
- And to keep track of number of games played for each game
- add app leaderboard per game
- choose a game that you can only play after signing up
- choose a game that you can only play after reaching a certain global score OR a certain amount of games played OR after playing at least one game of each.

- DONE add images
- DONE rename car right c1 by c4 and add this to 'lose' function
- make images (car) fit the square
- DONE Make frog visible on startup
- add 'plouf' and 'sprotch' when hitting water / car

## match four
- write better winConditions AND better checkForWin (inspired by noughts and crosses maybe?)

- add background image for grid and body
- add score counter & display
- make a 3-squares starting snake
- add speed settings

## tetris
- make it so that you can move when reaching bottom line (setInterval), before it freezes ( ```sleep().then()``` ? or "settimeout")
OR create an intermediate state between move and taken ?
- create rightRdge and leftEdge functions (and remove corresponding 'const' from moveRight & moveLeft ) && add them to rotation function
- for rotateLeft ==> make it so if current rotation 0 go to currentRotation 3 else currentRotation --
- Read about keyup / keydown / keypress differences
- create nextTetromino array by selecting the [0] of tetrominoes array?
- fix tetrominoes drawing so that they display properly (right under top & centered)
- fix nextDisplay shape (center) ==> perhaps could be done by fixing previous step ?
- set ŝpecific colors for each tetromino
- fix bug where a tetromino can 'merge' into another if moved just before reaching the 'taken' div ==> related to first point.
- fix tetromino position after removing lines (appears where it should be before line removal but doesnt seem to exist : doesnt move and disappears when 'real' tetromino reaches it)
- add different score count for 2, 3 and 4 lines
- DONE ( Thanks JBV !) fix rotateLeft (for L and T specially)
- DONE ( Thanks JBV !) fix bug making tetromino disappear if first in put is rotateLeft
- display next tetromino, scores and instructions together on the right of the game board
